mailto:renee@chandlersplumbing.com,"6071 Arlington Blvd Falls Church, VA 22044","There's a lot about indoor air quality that you might not know and certainly can't see. Up to 72 trillion microscopic irritants, or allergens, find their way into your home every day. They include dust, pollen, pet hair and dander, dust mites, mildew, lint, fungus, most tobacco smoke, cooking grease and bacteria. Many of these particles are so small that your nose and throat can't filter them out, and they can get deep into your lungs.  Breathe easier with American Standard's AccuClean air filtration system -- it removes 99.98% of particles and allergens from the air in your home. AccuClean is 100 times more effective than conventional 1"" throw-away filters and ionic room appliances.  Choosing an American Standard air conditioner or heat pump with an Energy Star logo is an important step to saving money on your utility bills--along with consuming less energy. What can you expect from a unit carrying the Energy Star logo? Air conditioners or heat pumps that have this symbol are at least 20 percent more efficient than the federal government's current efficiency standard. Purchasing an American Standard Heating & Air Conditioning unit with the Energy Star label ensures that you're getting the highest efficiency available. Be sure to ask your American Standard Heating & Air Conditioning dealer about local incentives that are offered by many utility companies and financial institutions for the purchase of Energy Star products.","Falls Church, VA 22044",,Chandlers Plumbing & Heating Co,,"mastercard, all major credit cards, amex, discover, visa",(571) 732-0552,rating-stars zero  ,6071 Arlington Blvd,http://www.chandlersplumbing.com

mailto:renee@chandlersplumbing.com,"6071 Arlington Blvd Falls Church, VA 22044","There's a lot about indoor air quality that you might not know and certainly can't see. Up to 72 trillion microscopic irritants, or allergens, find their way into your home every day. They include dust, pollen, pet hair and dander, dust mites, mildew, lint, fungus, most tobacco smoke, cooking grease and bacteria. Many of these particles are so small that your nose and throat can't filter them out, and they can get deep into your lungs.  Breathe easier with American Standard's AccuClean air filtration system -- it removes 99.98% of particles and allergens from the air in your home. AccuClean is 100 times more effective than conventional 1"" throw-away filters and ionic room appliances.  Choosing an American Standard air conditioner or heat pump with an Energy Star logo is an important step to saving money on your utility bills--along with consuming less energy. What can you expect from a unit carrying the Energy Star logo? Air conditioners or heat pumps that have this symbol are at least 20 percent more efficient than the federal government's current efficiency standard. Purchasing an American Standard Heating & Air Conditioning unit with the Energy Star label ensures that you're getting the highest efficiency available. Be sure to ask your American Standard Heating & Air Conditioning dealer about local incentives that are offered by many utility companies and financial institutions for the purchase of Energy Star products.","Falls Church, VA 22044",,Chandlers Plumbing & Heating Co,,"mastercard, all major credit cards, amex, discover, visa",(571) 732-0552,rating-stars zero  ,6071 Arlington Blvd,http://www.chandlersplumbing.com
